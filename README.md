# Programming-Portfolio
Portfolio of programming applications and project reports that I have worked on while attending University of Maryland University College. Most of the projects were done individually; however Awesome Movie Tickets project was accomplished by myself and 2 other students as our Final Project.
# About Me
Eager Junior Software Engineer enthusiastic about developing practical and time-saving software solutions.  Committed to working with client and project guidelines to deliver cost effective timely software applications.  Experience with software/database applications applying Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) principles.  As a United States Air Force veteran, developed the ability to communicate with all branches of the service with diplomacy and tact.  
# Awesome Movie Tickets
Team Awesome created a prototype of a stand-alone movie ticket kiosk application 
with a back-end Java foundation, SQL database and a front-end Java Graphical User 
Interface (GUI) and JPEG images.  The kiosk prototype can be accessed by using an 
Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as Eclipse or NetBeans, which 
connects to a MySQL database.  The team resource list consisted of a personal computers 
for programming (Apple/Linux/Windows OS), Internet access (LAN/Wi-Fi), IDE 
(Eclipse/NetBeans), database software (MySQL) and java database connection (Derby). 
# JUnit Testing
This was a homework assignment in a Software Testing Class that assessed my ability to design, code and prepare JUnit tests for a simple login application. Java code was used for the application. I designed and implement a comprehensive set of JUnit tests that included testing of the login form with successful/unsuccessful logging attempts and the logging functionality to the Log.txt file.
# Input Validation and Business Logic Security Controls
This was a homework assignment that demonstrated my knowledge of testing security controls aligned with input validation and business logic.  Using a combination of automated (OWASP ZAP) and manual methods to test UMUC Tutor application.
1.	Testing for Reflected Cross site scripting
A  JavaScript Alert was coded into the deleteSession.php file to determine if Reflected Cross Site Scripting was present.

2.	Testing for Stored Cross site scripting
Tried to input a pop-up window script into the username field to determine if Stored Cross site scripting was present.

3.	Testing for SQL Injection
Used automated testing to discover any SQL Injection vulnerabilities.  Fixed SQL Injection vulnerabilities.

4.	Testing for Code Injection
Spoke about ways to remediate code Injections and used Zap to demonstrate how to exploit Remote File Inclusion.

5.	Test business logic data validation
Spoke about ways an Attacker/Hackers can exploit and or break the functionality of applications.  Provided an example to test the Parent Directory from broken authentication methods.

6.	Test integrity checks
Test the use of drop-down methods within the application.  Provided examples of using an automated tool to find AutoComplete used for the passwords within the application and ways to fix this vulnerability.

7.	Test defenses against application misuse
Tested and provide ways to provide application-layer defensive mechanisms to protect the application.
