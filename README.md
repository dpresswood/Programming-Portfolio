Portfolio of programming applications that I have worked on.
Awesome Movie Tickets
Team Awesome created a prototype of a stand-alone movie ticket kiosk application 
with a back-end Java foundation, SQL database and a front-end Java Graphical User 
Interface (GUI) and JPEG images.  The kiosk prototype can be accessed by using an 
Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as Eclipse or NetBeans, which 
connects to a MySQL database.  The team resource list consisted of a personal computers 
for programming (Apple/Linux/Windows OS), Internet access (LAN/Wi-Fi), IDE 
(Eclipse/NetBeans), database software (MySQL) and java database connection (Derby).
