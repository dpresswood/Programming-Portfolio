# Programming/Web Development-Portfolio
Portfolio of programming/web development applications and project reports that I have worked on while attending University of Maryland University College. Most of the projects were done individually; however Awesome Movie Tickets project was accomplished by myself and 2 other students as our Final Project.
# About Me
Eager Software/Web Engineer enthusiastic about developing practical and time-saving software solutions.  Committed to working with client and project guidelines to deliver cost effective timely software applications.  Experience with software/database applications applying Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) principles.  As a United States Air Force veteran, developed the ability to communicate with all branches of the service with diplomacy and tact.  
# Awesome Movie Tickets
Team Awesome created a prototype of a stand-alone movie ticket kiosk application 
with a back-end Java foundation, SQL database and a front-end Java Graphical User 
Interface (GUI) and JPEG images. The kiosk prototype can be accessed by using an 
Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as Eclipse or NetBeans, which 
connects to a MySQL database. The team resource list consisted of a personal computers 
for programming (Apple/Linux/Windows OS), Internet access (LAN/Wi-Fi), IDE 
(Eclipse/NetBeans), database software (MySQL) and java database connection (Derby). 
# JUnit Testing
This was a homework assignment in a Software Testing Class that assessed my ability to design, code and prepare JUnit tests for a simple login application. Java code was used for the application. I designed and implement a comprehensive set of JUnit tests that included testing of the login form with successful/unsuccessful logging attempts and the logging functionality to the Log.txt file.

# Input Validation and Business Logic Security Controls
This was a homework assignment that demonstrated my knowledge of testing security controls aligned with input validation and business logic.  Using a combination of automated (OWASP ZAP) and manual methods to test UMUC Tutor application.
1.	Testing for Reflected Cross site scripting
A  JavaScript Alert was coded into the deleteSession.php file to determine if Reflected Cross Site Scripting was present.

2.	Testing for Stored Cross site scripting
Tried to input a pop-up window script into the username field to determine if Stored Cross site scripting was present.

3.	Testing for SQL Injection
Used automated testing to discover any SQL Injection vulnerabilities.  Fixed SQL Injection vulnerabilities.

4.	Testing for Code Injection
Spoke about ways to remediate code Injections and used Zap to demonstrate how to exploit Remote File Inclusion.

5.	Test business logic data validation
Spoke about ways an Attacker/Hackers can exploit and or break the functionality of applications.  Provided an example to test the Parent Directory from broken authentication methods.

6.	Test integrity checks
Test the use of drop-down methods within the application.  Provided examples of using an automated tool to find AutoComplete used for the passwords within the application and ways to fix this vulnerability.

7.	Test defenses against application misuse
Tested and provide ways to provide application-layer defensive mechanisms to protect the application.

# Testing Framework and Basic Security Controls 
This was a homework assignment that demonstrated my knowledge of creating a testing framework and using that framework to conduct some basic server and web application security controls.

Part 1. I described the testing framework and what each phase encompasses. I used examples to demonstrate my understanding of each testing framework.

Part 2. Used a Linux Virtual Machine to test Security Controls
1. To Fingerprint the Web Server, I used netcat tool to discover the web server software vendor and release. Discussed ways to mitigate vulnerabilities with Apache version 2.0.

2. Reviewed webpage comments and metadata for information leakage. I manually reviewed the sample HTML application source code in the Apache Web Server directories.

3. Tested HTTP Methods available on the virtual machine.

#Student GPA Application
This programming project involves writing a program to manage a student database. A combo box  allows the user to select one of  four database actions. The database was implemented as a HashMap, with the ID field as the key and a student record consisting of a name and major as the value. An operation is performed when the user clicks the Process Request button. If the user attempts to insert a key that is already in the database an error message is displayed using a JOptionPane message dialog box. If the user attempts to delete, find or update a record that is not in the database, a message is  displayed. After each successful operation is completed a JOptionPane window displays confirming the success. In the case of a successful Find request, a window should pop up containing the student's ID, name, major and current GPA. Performed Test Case Scenarios to show the functionality of each requirement.

# Web Page Foundations
I created and deployed a simple web page launched on Oracle Virtual-box with Ubuntu operating system and a text editor. Created Candles Unlimited Web page using HTML code comprised of formatted text, images, lists tables,hyperlinks and forms.  Look at the Lab3.Doc file to get a brief overview of the website and the fictitious products sold.
