# Programming/Web Development-Portfolio
During my time at the University of Maryland University College, I completed multiple programming and web development projects. While most of these projects were completed individually, one notable collaboration was the "Awesome Movie Tickets" project, which served as our Final Project and involved a team of three students, including myself. Here is a summary of some key applications and project reports I worked on:
# About Me
Eager Developer enthusiastic about developing practical and time-saving software solutions. Committed to working with client and project guidelines to deliver cost effective timely web applications. Experienced with all stages of the development cycle for software applications.  Broadly and deeply knowledgeable in a wide variety of computer languages as well as principles and techniques of website construction and maintenance.  
# Awesome Movie Tickets
During our collaboration on the "Awesome Movie Tickets" project, Team Awesome developed a standalone movie ticket kiosk application prototype. The prototype was built with a Java-based backend, utilized a SQL database, and featured a Java Graphical User Interface (GUI) along with JPEG images.
To access the kiosk prototype, we employed an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as Eclipse or NetBeans, which allowed seamless connectivity to a MySQL database. Our team made use of various resources including personal computers running Apple, Linux, or Windows operating systems, LAN or Wi-Fi for internet access, IDEs like Eclipse or NetBeans, MySQL as the database software, and Java Database Connection (JDBC) for database connectivity.
 
# JUnit Testing
As part of a Software Testing class assignment, I designed, coded, and prepared JUnit tests for a simple login application written in Java. I created a comprehensive set of JUnit tests that covered scenarios such as successful and unsuccessful login attempts and logging functionality to the Log.txt file.

# Input Validation and Business Logic Security Controls
This project showcased my knowledge of testing security controls related to input validation and business logic. I utilized a combination of automated tools like OWASP ZAP and manual methods to test the college Tutor application. I performed tests for reflected cross-site scripting, stored cross-site scripting, SQL injection, code injection, business logic data validation, integrity checks, defenses against application misuse, and more. I also discussed vulnerabilities and provided recommendations for mitigation.
1.	Testing for Reflected Cross site scripting
A  JavaScript Alert was coded into the deleteSession.php file to determine if Reflected Cross Site Scripting was present.

2.	Testing for Stored Cross site scripting
Tried to input a pop-up window script into the username field to determine if Stored Cross site scripting was present.

3.	Testing for SQL Injection
Used automated testing to discover any SQL Injection vulnerabilities.  Fixed SQL Injection vulnerabilities.

4.	Testing for Code Injection
Spoke about ways to remediate code Injections and used Zap to demonstrate how to exploit Remote File Inclusion.

5.	Test business logic data validation
Spoke about ways an Attacker/Hackers can exploit and or break the functionality of applications.  Provided an example to test the Parent Directory from broken authentication methods.

6.	Test integrity checks
Test the use of drop-down methods within the application.  Provided examples of using an automated tool to find AutoComplete used for the passwords within the application and ways to fix this vulnerability.

7.	Test defenses against application misuse
Tested and provide ways to provide application-layer defensive mechanisms to protect the application.

# Testing Framework and Basic Security Controls 
In this assignment, I demonstrated my understanding of creating a testing framework and implementing basic server and web application security controls. I described the testing framework phases and provided examples to illustrate each phase. Additionally, I used a Linux Virtual Machine to test security controls such as fingerprinting the web server, reviewing webpage comments and metadata for information leakage, and testing available HTTP methods.

# Student GPA Application
In this programming project I created a program to manage a student database. The database was designed as a HashMap, which allowed me to perform various actions such as inserting, deleting, finding, and updating records. To ensure functionality and requirements were met, I incorporated error handling and confirmation messages and performed test case scenarios.

# Web Page Foundations
For this project, I created and deployed a responsive web page using the LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP) on an Oracle VirtualBox with Ubuntu. I utilized HTML, CSS, and PHP to construct the Candles Unlimited web page, incorporating formatted text, images, lists, tables, hyperlinks, and forms. The page was designed to be responsive and adapt to different devices. Database management, file uploading, and DNS record configuration were also part of the project.

# PHP: Arrays, Functions and Form Processing 
The objective was to develop a basic PHP application by leveraging PHP's capabilities. The project requirements encompassed the following tasks:
1. Creating and testing PHP scripts that incorporate arrays.
2. Creating and testing PHP scripts that utilize functions.
3.	Creating, testing, and implementing PHP scripts for processing HTML forms.
This application allows users to log in to a website, select multiple products for purchase, and subsequently place an order for the chosen items. The requirements file will provide additional details and specifications necessary for the successful completion of the project.
